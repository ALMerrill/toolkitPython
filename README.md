# toolkitPython
Python port of [BYU CS 478 machine learning toolkit](http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/478/stuff/Toolkit.html)

Works with Python 2.7 or 3. Currently requires numpy and scipy to compute stats in matrix.py, but I'll probably change this soon for [pypy](http://pypy.org) compatibility.
