# toolkitPython
Python port of [BYU CS 478 machine learning toolkit](http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/478/stuff/Toolkit.html)

Works with Python 2.7 or 3. Currently requires [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org) to compute stats in matrix.py~~, but I'll probably change this soon for [pypy](http://pypy.org) compatibility~~. 

Update: If I do make a PyPy port I'll do it in a new branch. Thinking NumPy and SciPy could be handy to have, and might be actually faster than making the code PyPy compatible. If anyone has experience using PyPy vs. NumPy/SciPy for ML I would be grateful for your input.
